# (unscaled chis-square is used)
# worse fits means that constraining all other items leads to worse fit 
# - model would benefit from keeping them free
# i.e.  keeping the tested item free does not improve fit as much
# - parameters are close enough in the two groups that 
#   ... fit is not reduced very much if they are constrained to be equal
#   ... would also show as low chisq.diff when compared to strong model
# hence that is the best referent item
